##Overview
This example demonstrates how to use [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

##Prerequisites
Before starting, makes sure you've followed [Getting Started with LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Getting+started+with+LoopBack) to install Node and LoopBack. You will also need a basic undertsanding of LoopBack models](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Working+with+models).


##Procedure
Follow the steps below to create the application from scratch. Doing this will give you a better understanding of how to implement AngularJS as a front-end solution to LoopBack for your own app.

Otherwise, if you just want to see the example in action, do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-angular
cd loopback-example-angular
npm install
slc run
```

1. **Create the app**.
  Run `slc loopback`, and name the app `loopback-example-angular-starter`.

2. **Create the Task model**.
